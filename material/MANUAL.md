## Concept

The players try to save the nature and cultivate the surrounding. Therefore they like to raise
dried plants by using the rain. With their cannons, they need to fill/pump up the cloud on the screen
- which will store the water and release a shower as its reaches 100% saturation.
Afterwards the cloud vanishes and a new one appears in the center.

For each shot the marksman needs to consider the pressure, the volume, the degree and other physical
properties - to aim and hit !

Can both player work together and grow up the plants, before they are running out of time ?
