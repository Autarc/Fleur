## Introduction

During my studies in _Advanced Game Physics_ we got the chance to create a simple game to visualize
the kinematic behavior of interactive objects. Besides the restriction of using [Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing.js), I wanted to make a co-operative casual game with a hotseat mode.

## Info

The debugging mode is by default activated - therefore a grid will be displayed on the canvas
and the coordinates of the mouse movement will be tracked. To disable the debugging press ```1```.

TODO
