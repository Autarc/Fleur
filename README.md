Fleur - Physics to Growth
=========================

A Physical Simulation for two Players.

_Latest Release: 0.1.0 ([changelog](https://github.com/Autarc/Fleur/blob/master/HISTORY.md))_

## Introduction

During my studies in *Advanced Game Physics* we got the chance to create a simple game to visualize
the kinematic behavior of interactive objects. Besides the restriction of using [Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing.js), I wanted to make a co-operative casual game with a hotseat mode.
